# The Basics

# 1. Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.
first_name = "Jenesis"
last_name = "Merriman"

puts first_name + " " + last_name

# Use the modulo operator, division, or a combination of both to take a 4 digit number and find the digit in the: 1) thousands place 2) hundreds place 3) tens place 4) ones place
